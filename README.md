# Location Auto Fill

This project is an [Create React App ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boilerplate with integration of Redux, and Redux-observable for quick starting your redux applications with the power of RxJs


### [Demo]

Before starting with project, please headover to the [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md
) documentation.


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

`https://github.com/gkannan1989/location-autofill.git`

2. To run, go to project folder and run

`$ npm install`
or
`$ yarn install` (if you are using yarn)

3. Now start dev server by running -

`$ npm start`
or
`$ yarn start`

4. If the browser does not automatically for any reason visit - http://localhost:3000/

For more create-react-app commands refer `package.json`

## Code structure

### Components
Most of the generic layout is built in `/src/App.js` just as found in the original Create-React-App. The key thing to notice here is that we have included our one and only component to that file: namely `<CounterComponent />` which has been imported from our `/src/components` folder. I recommend you keep all of your components there unless you feel need to move them elsewhere.

### The Redux Store

The majority of the bootstrap code for the store is located in `/src/store.js`. By default, the [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)  is enabled so feel free to open that in Google Chrome to see what our Redux store looks like. 

**Note:** You will only benefit from having this enabled if you install the Google Chrome Extension which can be found at the above Redux Devtools hyperlink.

### Redux-Observable Integration

The logic for your reducers (aka Redux logic) will all be contained with `/src/reducers/`. The logic for your epics (aka Redux-Observable) will all be contained in `/src/epics`.

#### Understand that every action will go to a Reducer before going into any Epic.
